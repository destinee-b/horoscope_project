To compile: 1. make sure youre in right directory 2. javac -d bin src/\*.java

To run: java -cp bin Main

I ended up having to compile because my macbook is always having issues with java, when i deleted the bin folder, i still got an error but it would work, so it isn't necessary. i just wanted to add in the option and commands for it to be easier. plus i was originally taught to compile all my stuff in java haha.

i commented all code related to the api, i found one on reddit i thought was going to work but after i made the api calls i realized it hadnt been updated in 2 years in github and i wasn't getting a response so i think it isnt working anymore.

you will see in libs i had gson which was to help parse the json from the api, i didnt delete it but it isnt required since the api isnt working.
